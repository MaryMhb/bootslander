# bootslander
This is the first website I developed with a prepared template for HTML named "bootslander" and Django framework.
The purpose of the project was to challenge my abilities in Django.

1. clone:
run this command:
> git clone https://github.com/MaryMhb/bootslander.git
2. install virtual environment:
> pip install virtualenv
3. create and activate environment:
> python -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Django in your environment
> pip install Django
5. run server
> python manage.py runserver
